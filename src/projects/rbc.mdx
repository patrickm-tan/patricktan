## Introduction

Welcome to my time at the Royal Bank of Canada, also known as RBC! During my time, I worked as a design researcher on both personal and commercial banking products. 

//Brainstorm
My work at RBC will be divided into two main sections of focus; Personal and Commercial Banking. Each section will have key experiences and contributions (and challenges) to the projects I was able to work with.
