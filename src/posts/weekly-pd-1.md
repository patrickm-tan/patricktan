At the beginning of each new semester or school year, teachers are faced with the challenge of remembering names for a large number of new students.

Design an experience to help an educator match faces to names, with the goal of shortening the time needed to reach complete un-aided accuracy. 

Welcome to this week's product design! This blog series is meant to be a fun and lightweight exercise to practice my design and creative skills! a collection of product design challenges from Artiom's Weekly Product Design Exercise. I have challenged myself to create a design within 2 hours. 

The goal in each week is to sketch and design an appropiate concept based on the given context within 2 hours. Then talk about some of the design decisions I made, and how can we incorporate UX research!

An important note for university/college students, there are a lot of students and the best way for the professor/lecturer to remember you is meeting them during office hours!
